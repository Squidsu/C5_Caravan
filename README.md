Citroen C5 Caravan Self Levelling Suspension
This Project involves helping a friend of mine who has created a caravan out of a Citroen C5. The C5 has hydropneumatic suspension which is self levelling but with only the rear
half of the car the control unit aren't there so she has made the suspension work and i'm making it self levelling.
